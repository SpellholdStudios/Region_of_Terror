## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

The mod is based on the adventures of Drizzt Do'Urden. I've taken some liberties and the main story is pulled out from a hat. The mod puts in Drizzt and his companions as playable NPC's and you'll be able to play with him through the old and new quests. The mod contains several new big quests and adds in four new cities/villages/towns. There are many smaller quests and some of the quests have different possibilities for endings, including the main story.

More information can be found on the website (link is at the bottom of the file). (Please note, that some parts of the website are very old, including the screenshots which were taken in 2002).

**Key features:**
- Big main story involving Drizzt and the main character.
- 30-40 hours of additional gameplay.
- More than 35 new quests.
- More than 160 new areas.
- 10 new NPCs.
- More than 400 new creatures.
- Hundreds of new items.
- 20+ new kits.
- New spells (mostly kit-specific).
- Special features (check the website).
- Mod maker's house (Use codes and enter area "RA4400").
- SECRETS!!!!

<details><summary>History: original readme from from Gilgamesh (v1.0A)</summary>
<p>

I began working on this mod in Spring 2002. It is almost completely done by me and the work took 2,5 years. It was a hobby for me and I worked when I felt like it.<br>
TDD and EE were the only mods out when I began working and I have been using mostly the same methods as in those mods (which are nowadays old-fashioned). However hopefully some people will be able to enjoy the mod.<br>
The mod was sheltered by TEAMBG for a long time but after they shut down I moved to FORGOTTEN WARS. I received most of the help I needed from the TEAMBG forums.<br>
I don't speak English as my first language and I've grown a lot during the creation of the mod so you may be able to notice some differences in style here and there. I've tried to use as good English as possible but it is not too great. I hope it won't bother anyone much.<br>
Everything you'll find from the mod is just improvisation. Ideas that have sprung up from my mind that I have then created in the game. The Final Fantasies have had some influence for example.<br>
Unfortunately I didn't like modding and finished only because I refused to quit. The ToB compatibility and NPC dialogs (banters) were never done.<br>
If they are to be done, I won't be the one who does them.<br>

<details><summary>History: a note from King Diamond (v2.0)</summary>
<p>

As a big lover of all that is really BIG :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: I've decided to give this mod another chance to survive in the modern environments (you know - "generation Pepsi", "Greece - European Champions" and stuff...). So, here is another humble attempt not to screw anything that is supposed to work properly.<br>

Some installation notes:

- If you want to install RoT along with TDD you can't use Kit Packs from both mods unless you have TobEx. Plz choose which one you want to install or install TobEx first. In any case, install RoT AFTER TDD v1.10 (or later).
- Don't forget to install the latest Worldmap mod from Yacomo/Weigo (v6 or later). Local RoT's WMP just doesn't know about any other mod existence.<br>

Cheers,<br>
and stay heavy,<br>

## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: the original Baldur's Gate II (BG2 or just SoA) with the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE), the conversion projects Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT) and Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET).

Region of Terror is a WeiDU mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. It is only compatible with BGII: ToB. However, we cannot test every single one. If you encounter any bugs, please <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/168-region-of-terror/">report them on the forum</a>!

>Classical game players are strongly recommended to download and install the latest version of the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.<br>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-rot.exe`**, un-install all previously installed components and delete the :file_folder: **rot** folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Region of Terror for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: rot folder and a setup-rot.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-rot.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-rot.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Mac OS X

Region of Terror for Mac OS X is distributed is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: rot folder, setup-rot and setup-rot.command files in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-rot.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-rot.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

Region of Terror for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, **cd** to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, run **`WeInstall setup-rot`** in your game folder. Then run **`wine BGMain.exe`** and start playing.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-rot --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>


<hr>


## <a name="components" id="components"></a>Components

The installer includes the following components. The number of each is the component *DESIGNATED* number which gives it a fixed install position, lets other components and mods detect it and allows automated installers to specify component choices.<br /><br />


#### 0. Main component

This component installs the mod itself.</br>

## 

#### 1. Region Of Terror Kit Pack
